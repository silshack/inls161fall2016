Links to assignments will be listed here as they are posted. 


In order to view an assignment, click the corresponding link below. 
You will be asked to confirm acceptance of the assignment.
Then you will be taken to a GitHub repo with instructions, source code, and other materials that will help you to complete the assignment. 

As I mentioned in class, **Please do not begin an assignment until I give you the go-ahead in class**.  Generally, I love students working ahead but if you work ahead before I've updated the assignment you may have to delete your repo and start over.
