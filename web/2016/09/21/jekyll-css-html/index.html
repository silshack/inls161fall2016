<p><strong>Reminder:</strong> Your first community engagement activity needs to be completed and written up before Fall Break begins on October 19th.</p>

<p>For most of class today, we will spend time creating our base site and then exploring ways that we can change and customize the style to our liking. </p>

<p>We&#39;ll learn a little bit about CSS and about linking resources so that they show up where we want them. 
<excerpt/></p>

<h1 id="q-amp-a">Q&amp;A</h1>

<ul>
<li>It&#39;s time to get started on Assignment #2! Come to class having selected a theme for your blog, and with it cloned into a new Cloud9 workspace (not forked!) and in a brand new Github repo.</li>
<li>Start Assignment 2 by clicking the github classroom link on the Assignments tab if you haven&#39;t already.  The Readme in the repo you&#39;ll get when you do that has the full details of the assignment. Read ahead but don&#39;t race ahead.  We&#39;ll do much of the work together.</li>
<li>Approach this work creatively! There were some really neat sites that came out of the last class and I hope this will be an opportunity for you to learn neat things and express yourself.</li>
</ul>

<h1 id="linking">Linking</h1>

<p>Linking is what makes the Internet what it is in terms of how information is organized. 
Without links, we would have to know the location of every single thing we wish to get to. 
We would have to index everything: that is, we would need a list. 
Linking allows us to move between resources, call and embed resources within one another, and in some cases find resources based on their relationships. </p>

<h3 id="relative-and-absolute-paths">Relative and absolute paths</h3>

<p>We have choices about how we can link to resources. </p>

<p>Let&#39;s look at the links in the examples on the last page:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-html" data-lang="html"><span class="nt">&lt;link</span> <span class="na">rel=</span><span class="s">"stylesheet"</span> <span class="na">href=</span><span class="s">"css/styles.css"</span><span class="nt">&gt;</span>
<span class="nt">&lt;script </span><span class="na">src=</span><span class="s">"js/scripts.js"</span><span class="nt">&gt;&lt;/script&gt;</span>
<span class="nt">&lt;img</span> <span class="na">src=</span><span class="s">"images/pretty.img"</span> <span class="na">alt=</span><span class="s">"A pretty picture"</span> <span class="nt">/&gt;</span>
<span class="nt">&lt;a</span> <span class="na">href=</span><span class="s">"index.html"</span> <span class="na">title=</span><span class="s">"Home"</span><span class="nt">&gt;</span>Return home.<span class="nt">&lt;/a&gt;</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>These are all examples of relative paths. 
This means that they assume that the files referenced here are located near our index page. </p>

<p>If we were to represent the same links with absolute paths, we would have to add the domain name / hostname also. 
See below:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-html" data-lang="html"><span class="nt">&lt;link</span> <span class="na">rel=</span><span class="s">"stylesheet"</span> <span class="na">href=</span><span class="s">"http://www.somewebsite.com/css/styles.css"</span><span class="nt">&gt;</span>
<span class="nt">&lt;script </span><span class="na">src=</span><span class="s">"http://www.somewebsite.com/js/scripts.js"</span><span class="nt">&gt;&lt;/script&gt;</span>
<span class="nt">&lt;img</span> <span class="na">src=</span><span class="s">"http://www.somewebsite.com/images/pretty.img"</span> <span class="na">alt=</span><span class="s">"A pretty picture"</span> <span class="nt">/&gt;</span>
<span class="nt">&lt;a</span> <span class="na">href=</span><span class="s">"http://www.somewebsite.com/index.html"</span> <span class="na">title=</span><span class="s">"Home"</span><span class="nt">&gt;</span>Return home.<span class="nt">&lt;/a&gt;</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>Let&#39;s consider the advantages and disadvantages of each of these approaches and ask these questions:</p>

<ol>
<li>What happens if we have to change our doman name or move to a different server?</li>
<li>Is there perhaps a way to automate such a change and still provide an absolute path?</li>
</ol>

<p>Let&#39;s move on to working with visual elements.</p>

<h1 id="css">CSS</h1>

<p>CSS is an acronym for &quot;Cascading Style Sheet.&quot;</p>

<p>If HTML is the medium for web content, then CSS is the medium for the visual styling of the web. 
Whenever a website looks like anything other than just a blank page, there is CSS involved. </p>

<p>We will continue to use a combination of Markdown, HTML5 and CSS3 to construct our very own web pages. </p>

<h1 id="embedding-with-iframes">Embedding with iframes</h1>

<p>iframes are a way of loading one site within another.  They&#39;re really cool.</p>

<p>For instance, Trinket embeds let you put interactive code anywhere.  Here&#39;s an embed that lets me generate pairs for this class:</p>

<iframe src="https://trinket.io/embed/python/0556f1a69d" width="100%" height="406" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

<p>Google Maps, SoundCloud, YouTube and whole host of other neat sites have embeds.  The embed code is usually available in the &#39;Share&#39; dialogs.  Some embeds are created with Javascript and have a <code>&lt;script&gt;</code> tag.  Think about how you can enhance your site with cool embeds.</p>

<h1 id="theme-cleanup">Theme Cleanup</h1>

<p>I got a little ahead of myself last time.</p>

<p>So far you&#39;ve:</p>

<ul>
<li>Picked a theme</li>
<li>Cloned that theme to a new Cloud9 Workspace (if you forked it, see below)</li>
<li>Made an empty repository on github called <code>[username].github.io</code></li>
</ul>

<p>Now we need to:</p>

<ul>
<li>install jekyll on the new workspace with <code>gem install github-pages</code></li>
<li>Configure the new site (see below)</li>
<li>still in the workspace, change <code>origin</code> to point to the new</li>
</ul>

<h1 id="if-you-forked-up">If You Forked Up</h1>

<p>Everyone forks up sometimes.  I want your new repo to be on its own, not a fork of the theme&#39;s repo, because that will be easier later.</p>

<p>Make sure you&#39;ve cloned your code to Cloud9.  Delete the forked repo on Github.  Make a new empty one titled as I described above. Now you should be able to continue as if you&#39;d cloned, making sure to change the remote url below.</p>

<h1 id="configure">Configure</h1>

<p>Once we have the base theme cloned, we need to make sure that the site is going to show up at the right address. </p>

<p>The address that we want is <code>http://YOUR-GITHUB-USERNAME.github.io</code>. This is the default user site address for GitHub pages.</p>

<p>GH Pages will serve this site from code in the master branch of a repository in your account named the same as the fully qualified domain name (FQDN) or just the full URL to our desired site. </p>

<p>Therefore, if your GH Pages user site defaults to <code>http://YOUR-GITHUB-USERNAME.github.io</code> then we have to make a repository in your account titled <code>YOUR-GITHUB-USERNAME.github.io</code>. That&#39;s why we did that.</p>

<p>Now we need to push the code to this new repo.  Since we cloned the repo, <code>origin</code> is currently set to the old location.  Now that you have a new repo with a new <code>.git</code> URL, we can change where the tag <code>origin</code> points to:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-" data-lang=""># Change origin's URL
git remote set-url origin [paste URL here]

# then verify the new URL is there:
git remote -v
</code></pre></div>
<p>Great! an initial <code>git push</code> and your code should be up on github.  You should see it at your special URL.  Tommy&#39;s is <a href="http://tommytester.github.io">http://tommytester.github.io</a></p>

<p>If that&#39;s not working for you, we&#39;ve got to dive into config quickly.</p>

<h2 id="_config-yml">_config.yml</h2>

<p>After running <code>jekyll serve --host $IP --port $PORT</code> you may notice some broken links or missing styles.  We&#39;ll now fix these together.</p>

<p>Open <code>_config.yml</code> in Cloud9. We will likely have to change three variables, if they exist: <code>path</code>, <code>url</code>, and <code>baseurl</code>.
These will be different for different themes, so we&#39;ll look over this together in class. Basic principles are as follows:</p>

<p>You want <code>url</code> to match the desired URL for your site: <code>http://YOUR-GITHUB-USERNAME.github.io</code>.</p>

<p><code>path</code> specifies a path where files are held. 
For the GH Pages user site, it needs to have no value. You can either delete that line, comment it, or just put a set of double quotes to specify that Jekyll should not try to rewrite the links and append a subdirectory. It will look like this:</p>

<p><code>path: &quot;&quot;</code></p>

<p>The same is true for <code>baseurl</code>: it should be blank or not exist.</p>

<p>All that these do is tell Jekyll where things are when it is trying to build the site. 
Remember, linking is dynamic in the build process, so Jekyll is trying to figure out how to tell your browser where to find stuff that it needs to render the site. </p>

<h1 id="for-next-time">For next time</h1>

<p>I want you to continue to work with your site and actually begin creating some content: write your first real blog post for this class. You&#39;ll do this just as you did before, creating a file in the <code>_posts</code> diurectory, following Jekyll&#39;s naming conventions for the filename.</p>

<p>This involves having an idea, making an outline of what you want to say about that idea, committing some text, referencing outside information, and maybe putting a picture in to give a visual anchor to your text.  You&#39;ll probably be writing about commands and code a lot.  Use inline code blocks to reference commands like <code>cd</code> and full codeblocks to call out or sequence commands:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-" data-lang="">pwd
cd ~
</code></pre></div>
<p>Add a language name to enable syntax highlighting on these fenced code blocks. </p>

<p>You can also use jekyll&#39;s built-in <code>{% highlight %}</code> tag to add spiffy syntax highlighting to your code the old school way. Learn more here: <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/docs/templates/#code-snippet-highlighting">https://jekyllrb.com/docs/templates/#code-snippet-highlighting</a></p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-html" data-lang="html"><span class="nt">&lt;h1&gt;</span>Syntax Highlighing in Jekyll<span class="nt">&lt;/h1&gt;</span>

<span class="nt">&lt;p&gt;</span>It's <span class="nt">&lt;strong&gt;</span>really<span class="nt">&lt;/strong&gt;</span> cool!<span class="nt">&lt;/p&gt;</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>I would also like you to move through the W3Schools HTML5 and CSS3 tutorials on your own, outside of class.<label for='css-tutorial' class='margin-toggle sidenote-number'></label><input type='checkbox' id='css-tutorial' class='margin-toggle'/><span class='sidenote'><strong>Read:</strong> “HTML Tutorial.” W3Schools. <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/html/default.asp">http://www.w3schools.com/html/default.asp</a>.<br/><br/>“CSS Tutorial.” W3Schools. <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/css/default.asp">http://www.w3schools.com/css/default.asp</a>. </span>  Go quickly if this is all review for you (though you should learn a thing or two!) and set aside some real time for them if this is all new to you.</p>
