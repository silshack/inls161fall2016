Assignment 3 is due at midnight tomorrow!  


# For next week

Next week we will use similar methods to help to automate the collection and formatting of data in flat data tables. 
Through this we will learn more about pipes and redirecting output.{% sidenote 'csv' 'Connelly, Brian. “Working with CSVs on the Command Line.” http://bconnelly.net/. Last modified September 23, 2013. http://bconnelly.net/working-with-csvs-on-the-command-line/.' %}
