We'll spend most of the time on Assignment 5 today.

Only one more to go after this!

# Next time

Next time we are going to begin talking about presentations and creating good presentation materials in earnest. 

I would like you to read/deep skim Edward Tufte's piece on the stupidity of PowerPoint.{% sidenote 'powerpoint' 'Tufte, Edward R. The Cognitive Style of Powerpoint: Pitching Out Corrupts Within. Cheshire, Connecticut: Graphics Press, 2011. http://users.ha.uth.gr/tgd/pt0501/09/Tufte.pdf.' %} 

## Exemplars

I would also like you to view the following video of a talk by Lawrence Lessig.
We will look at parts of this in class as well, but it would be good if you could sit down and view the whole thing over the course of the weekend.
It exists in four parts linked below.

## Reveal.js

We will be using reveal.js to create presentations. 
Please click through this demo presentation and see what is possible to do with it.{% sidenote 'reveal' 'El Hattab, Hakim. Reveal.js: The HTML5 Presentation Framework. http://lab.hakim.se/reveal-js/#/.' %} 
You can also view the source code for the demo presentation. 
We will look at this together in detail. 

## Thought leaders and TED Talks

You should also give the following video a watch.
It will help put into perspective what is really happening when we watch TED Talks and similar presentations.
