**Don't forget to email me the link to you first community engagement event before midnight!**

Today's class is entierly optional.  But I hope you decide to show up.

This is a day to either fix things that bother you about your site or to continue hacking on it.  You might want to respond to feedback I've given you or just proceed with swankification.  I'll be here to help you out and maybe teach a few extra things we won't get to in a real class.

Please come with a **problem** or a **project** in mind, the more specific the better.  Hack days are always best with a little forethought.

Have a great Fall break!
